# Movie DB React APP With AJAX
Usage of AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in Modern Web Applications
# Usage of AJAX
This project is aimed at demonstrating the concept of AJAX, a set of web development techniques used on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. By using AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server 
asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. This simple web application built in react web application fetches movie data from `https://www.themoviedb.org/` and allows users to search movies based on movie id.
# How to Run the Project Locally
- Before running the application locally, make sure you have the following installed:
  - Node.js
  - npm (Node Package Manager)
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
  `git clone https://github.com/ali7haider/Movie_DB_ReactAPP_AJAX_Usage`
- Open the project directory and run `npm start` in the cmd.
- The app will run on the local host.
# Performance Measure
Using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for fetching data from a movie database can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your web application. AJAX allows you to make asynchronous requests to the server without reloading the entire page, enabling a smoother user experience.
In an app that retrieves data from a movie database, AJAX can be utilized for various tasks such as fetching movie details, searching for specific movies, loading lists of movies, and more. Here's how AJAX enhances performance and user experience.
